              Alternative vechicle's has become increasingly popular with the narrative that that they decrease carbon footprint.
              With the increase of registrations for alternative vechicles, it poses the question; Are alternative vechicles in fact reducing 
              carbon footprint, or are these vechicles trading one carbon footprint for another. 

            <p> In California, as we see an increase in Electric Vehicle (EV) registrations over time, do we see a corresponding net decrease in carbon emissions and an increase in electricity consumption.
              The reason California was selected is due to the state having the highest number of registered EVs, the highest population density of any US State, and many supportive policies and programs to increase the usage of EVs.      
              The core tenant of answering this is that we are trading one carbon footprint source for another, and not truly helping reduce carbon emissions.
            </p>

              California was chosen for this study as California has shown the largest number of registrations for alternative vechicles.
              Additionally, California has the highest population density of an US state, as well as many supportive policies and incentive programs
              to increase the usage of alternative vechicles. With research and data collection, the goal of this project is to identify if alternative 
              vechicles are beneficial for the environment, or counterproductive.
