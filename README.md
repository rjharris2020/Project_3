# Electric Vehicle Data Visualization Project

## Project Proposal
For this project, our team decided to look into electric vehicles and the general question of: Do we see a corresponding net decrease in carbon emissions and an increase in electricity consumption with the increase of electric vehicle registerations in California. California has the highest number of registered electric vehicles, the highest population density of the US, and provides more programs and incentives to increase the usage of EVs.
